# Website

Click [here](https://www.kahootflooder.me)(https://www.kahootflooder.me) for the website.

# Download/Build
There are downloads for mac, not windows (cause I dont own it). You can use the website, or built it your self.

## Replit has been removed due to the new website/app that runs replit for you.

### Windows 

Please note that you are going to be downloading V1.
App development in progress.

1. Go [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.13.0/node-v16.13.0-x86.msi) and it should download the msi file, open it and follow the instructions to install node. If you have it, skip this step.
2. Create a new folder on your dekstop (or anywhere else) and open windows powershell. (Press the windows key on your keyboard then type in "powershell" and open it.)
3. In powershell, type in cd then a space, then drag your new folder you just created in. Press enter. 
4. After that, it should say: C: (or H:)\yourfolder
5. Type in npm init -y keep pressing enter if it asks you for anything.
6. Close windows powershell then go into the folder you created and delete a file that is named "index.js". (if you dont have it, skip this)
7. Once that is completed, click [here](https://github.com/Kief5555/kahoot-flooder/archive/refs/tags/0.01.zip) to download the kahoot flooder code.
8. Open the zip file you just downloaded and drag the all the contents into the folder you created earlier. Drag the src file in too, but ignore it.
9. Reopen powershell and see if you still have C: (or H:)\the folder name you created earlier. If you dont, do step 3 and come back to this step after. Type in "npm i"
10. Type in "node flood.js". If there is an error like this [here](https://ibb.co/m6hkG3V) follow the instuctions [here](https://github.com/Kief5555/kahoot-flooder/blob/main/src-issue.md). If you dont have the issue, your good!

### Mac
* Hold your horses! App is almost ready!
