* If you do not have this issue, __Please do not do any or the step provided here.__


## Well, you ran into an issue.
* To fix the issue, you need to do the following:
* In the folder that you downloded, or cloned, earlier, the is a src folder.
* By the way, this issue will be fixed when I make the app

## Replit

### The easy way (might not work)
 1. Go to replit.com then log in if you are not. After that, clickt he "repls" tab on the left. You should see your old repl you downloaded press the 3 dots next to it on the right, then delete it.
 2. Go to [here](https://replit.com/@PrintedWaste/Kahoot-flooder-or-SRC-FIX?v=1) and press fork
 3. Run the project.


### The slightly more harder way

* If you are confused, go to the easy way and try it out

1. You need to go the the "shell" tab on the right.
2. Type in "mv node_modules edit_modules" in the shell.
3. On the left side you should see files and folders, there should be a new folder called "edit_modules" Click it.
4. You will see a big list, scroll down and find "kahoot.js-updated", click it
5. In the code editor, find the src folder again and drag it into the kahoot.js-updated folder. 
6. Go back to the shell, and type in "mv edit_modules node modules"
7. Run it, you should be fine

## Windows

* If you dont understand this, consider replit.
